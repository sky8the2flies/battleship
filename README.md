## Getting Started
### Rules
Rules for battleship are very simple:
1. Place your five ships within the 10x10 grid.
2. _Fire_ missles at the opponents ships which are also within the grid.
3. Once you _destroy_ all of the opponents ships, replay the game!

### Play

## Next Steps
- [] I would love to add images of the actual ships, I will learn more CSS and begin work on this.
- [] I also want to add some sort of animation for the _missles_.
- [] The AI currently works off of random positions, would be fun to make it know what ships are left and _search_ for positions according to the size.
- [] Allow the user to drag and drop their ships into the desired positions.
